Upgrade the CURRENT AetherVision UltraGuardian app. 
Do NOT create a new project. 
Modify and improve the existing codebase.

There are TWO main tasks:
1) Add 5 new Smart City features
2) Fix and clean up ALL text / writing / labels in the UI


TASK 1 — ADD 5 NEW SMART CITY FEATURES


All 5 features must live INSIDE the "Smart City Control Hub" as new sections or panels.
They must also connect with the existing city/state data, OmegaCore, and Guardians.

FEATURE A — Citizen Live Sentiment Radar

Add a new panel in the Smart City Control Hub:

Name: "Citizen Sentiment Radar"

For each city/state, show:
• Live mood meter (Happy / Neutral / Stressed / Angry / Worried)
• Sentiment score (0–100)
• Short AI summary: "How citizens are feeling about pollution right now"
Simulate data internally (no real social media API required).

UI:
• Circular radar or gauge
• Color changes with sentiment (green → yellow → red)


FEATURE B — Crime–Pollution Link Engine

Add panel: "Crime–Pollution Link"

For each city/state:
• Show correlation between:
  – Traffic congestion
  – Heat stress
  – Night-time pollution
  – Crime risk index
• AI explanation: how pollution & stress can increase crime risk
• Simple graph: Pollution vs Crime trend

Use simulated but consistent data.


FEATURE C — Disaster Aftershock Pollution Tracker

Add panel: "Disaster Aftershock Tracker"

For each disaster type (flood, cyclone, earthquake, heatwave):
• Show how pollution changes AFTER the event:
  – Air pollution spike
  – Water contamination
  – Waste and debris impact
• Timeline graph: Before → During → After disaster
• AI text: "How long until the city recovers?"

Integrate with Crisis Predictor and Guardians.


FEATURE D — AI Green Budget Planner

Add panel: "Green Budget Planner"

For each city/state:
• User can choose a budget slider (for example: 10 crore – 1000 crore)
• AI shows:
  – Best way to spend the budget on green actions
  – Expected pollution reduction %
  – Priority actions list (EV, trees, filters, public transport, etc.)
• Economic + Environmental benefit summary

Connect to Economic Loss module and OmegaCore suggestions.


FEATURE E — Emergency Command Mode (Red Alert)

Add a toggle or big button in the Smart City Control Hub:

Name: "Emergency Command Mode"

When ON:
• UI goes into RED ALERT theme (subtle but visible)
• Crisis Predictor runs at high frequency (simulated)
• Show top 3 emergency actions to take RIGHT NOW
• Show which Guardians are in high alert (Air, Disaster, Traffic etc.)
• Add a small flashing alert icon and text: "CITY IN EMERGENCY MODE"

When OFF:
• Return to normal neon theme
• Emergency indicators disappear


TASK 2 — FIX ALL TEXT / WRITING / LABELS


Clean up the entire UI copy.

1) Correct all spelling and grammar:
   • Fix any wrong words like "INITLIAZING" → "Initializing"
   • Remove strange or broken English phrases
   • Remove random all-caps text unless it's a label

2) Make text consistent and professional:
   • Use clear, short, modern English
   • Example style:
     - "System Online – Stable"
     - "City Risk Score"
     - "Future 2050 Simulation"
   • Avoid over-complicated sci-fi words that are hard to read

3) Standardize headings and labels:
   • All section titles: Title Case
   • Buttons: short and clear ("Initialize", "Run Analysis", "View Solutions")
   • Tooltips: 1–2 line simple English explanations

4) Dashboard clean-up:
   • Replace "SYSTEM DEMO SIMULATION" with a better line:
     "Smart City Intelligence Overview"
   • Make sure all boxes have clear headings and meaning

5) Smart City Control Hub:
   • Use neat headings like:
     "City Control Panel"
     "State Control Panel"
     "Guardian Status"
     "OmegaCore Intelligence"
     "Aura Booster Effects"
     "Global Teleport View"
   • Remove any duplicate or confusing phrases

6) Keep the vibe futuristic but readable:
   • Neon style stays, but text must be easy for judges and professors to understand
   • No random jargon, no meaningless numbers

7) Language:
   • All on-screen text should be in clean English only (no mixed spelling).
   • Keep tone professional but slightly futuristic.


INTEGRATION & FINAL CLEANUP

• All 5 new features MUST appear as separate, well-organized panels INSIDE the Smart City Control Hub.
• They must be fully interactive with simulated data.
• All modules (Dashboard, Pollution All Type, Analysis, Guardians, Omega Core, Aura, India Map, Smart City Control Hub) must remain ACTIVE from first load.
• No "LOCKED" or "OFFLINE" screens anywhere.
• Ensure there are no broken buttons, empty panels, or placeholder text left.

Do NOT ask any follow-up questions.
Directly update the existing codebase, regenerate the necessary components, and return the fully upgraded, polished Smart City AI platform.
