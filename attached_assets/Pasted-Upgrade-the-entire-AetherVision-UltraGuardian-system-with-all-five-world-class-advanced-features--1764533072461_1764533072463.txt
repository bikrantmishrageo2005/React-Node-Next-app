• Probability of extreme pollution  
• Probability of heatwave spike  
• Probability of flood/drought  
• 72-hour danger forecast  
• 7-day risk prediction  
• “Why this danger exists” explanation  

Add UI:
• CrisisMeter (neon red arc)  
• “High-Risk Event Detected” animation  
• OmegaCore emergency response suggestions  

========================================================
FEATURE 3 — HUMAN HEALTH IMPACT PANEL
========================================================
Add a new component: <HealthImpact />

For every city and state show:
• Asthma risk %  
• Lung damage risk %  
• Heart stress risk %  
• Eye irritation level  
• Heat stroke risk  
• Child hazard score  
• Elderly hazard score  
• Overall Health Impact Index  

Use simulated but realistic values.
Integrate with:
• Analysis  
• Guardians  
• Omega Core  

========================================================
FEATURE 4 — ECONOMIC LOSS CALCULATOR
========================================================
Add a new module: <EconomicLoss />

For each state and city calculate:
• Daily economic loss due to pollution  
• Healthcare cost impact  
• Productivity loss  
• Industry shutdown loss  
• Transportation delay loss  
• Seasonal disaster damage estimate  

Show charts:
• Line graph (daily loss)  
• Bar graph (sector-wise loss)  
• Pie chart (loss distribution)  

Add OmegaCore recommendations:
• “How to reduce economic loss by 20%”  
• “Which pollution type creates maximum financial damage”  

========================================================
FEATURE 5 — AETHERVISION FUTURE 2050 SIMULATION
========================================================
Add a futuristic simulation engine: <Future2050 />

This module must simulate:
• Pollution levels in 2030, 2040, 2050  
• Heat rise forecast  
• AQI future curve  
• Population density growth  
• Future green zones  
• Future flood zones  
• Sea-level rise prediction  
• City survivability index  
• “What will this city look like in 2050?”  
• Neon hologram animation on map  

Add timeline slider:
• User drags from 2024 → 2030 → 2040 → 2050  
• Map updates automatically  

========================================================
